<h2>Why force creation?</h2>
<p>
	At the first analysis, an Understand database is generated with your parameters. By default the plugin will re-use this database for each analysis.
	You have to force the creation of the database if you add a new langage at the analysis. If it's not the case, it's preferable to let this option unchecked.
